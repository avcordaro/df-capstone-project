# Capstone Project - Alex and Brian
This repository contains our capstone project notebooks, saved model files and presentation. 

The dataset we used is too large to be stored in this repository, but it can be downloaded from Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7/data

You will have to unzip the downloaded dataset in this root folder if you wish to rerun any of the notebooks, as well as unzipping the two model files.
