# Disease Identification of Apple Leaves
Capstone Project - Alex & Brian

**Description:** Based on a competition from Kaggle in 2020, we use deep learning models to perform image classification and localization on photos of apple leaves. Our objective is to assess the health of each leaf and plot the location of the leaf in the image.

**Motivation:** Failing to properly diagnose diseases on agricultural crops can lead to the misuse of chemicals and the emergence of resistant pathogen strains. This has dire concequences for input costs and environmental impacts. Currently, disease diagnosis is done by humans scouting around the crop fields. This is time-consuming and expensive. Computer-vision based models have the promise to increase the efficiency and accuracy of this process. In this project's case, the crops being diagnosed are the leaves on apple trees.

This repository contains our capstone project notebooks, saved model files and presentation. 

The dataset we used is too large to be stored in this repository, but it can be downloaded from Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7/data

You will have to unzip the downloaded dataset in this root folder if you wish to rerun any of the notebooks, as well as unzipping the two model files.
